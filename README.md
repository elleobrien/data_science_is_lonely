# Data for "Data Sciencer is Lonely"
Anonymized data and semi-structured interview guide about interview participants from O'Brien & Mick, 2024.

The data table corresponds to Supplemental Table S1, which can be used to derive Tables 1 & 2 in the main manuscript.
We have applied coarse binning to features like "Years in research" and "Research area" in order to obscure the identity of participants. 

Please reach out to the corresponding author, Elle O'Brien, at elleobri@umich.edu with any questions or ideas for future study.
